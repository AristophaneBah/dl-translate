# DL Translate (Côte d’Ivoire Driver License)

DL Translate is a backend service designed to convert foreign driver license documents
(specifically Côte d’Ivoire licenses) into **structured, DMV-ready English translations**.

This project focuses on **document understanding rather than generic translation**.
Instead of translating raw text line-by-line, it extracts key identity fields,
normalizes them, and outputs a certified translation PDF suitable for administrative use.

The architecture emphasizes:
- Deterministic parsing
- Transparency of extracted fields
- Predictable and auditable outputs

This makes the system well-suited for compliance-driven workflows where accuracy,
traceability, and formatting matter more than linguistic creativity.

##  What This Project Is (and Is Not)

This project is **not a full AI-powered system** and does not claim to be perfect.

It is an **engineering-first prototype** that demonstrates:
- OCR-driven data extraction
- Rule-based parsing and normalization
- Document formatting for official use cases

Some edge cases, OCR noise, and layout variations are **expected and accepted** at this stage.
The goal is clarity, structure, and correctness — not black-box intelligence.

Future versions may integrate:
- AI-assisted field correction
- Confidence scoring
- Interactive validation via a frontend or chatbot

### API Endpoints

- `/ocr/civ` → JSON extraction + normalized fields  
- `/pdf/civ` → Downloadable certified translation PDF
